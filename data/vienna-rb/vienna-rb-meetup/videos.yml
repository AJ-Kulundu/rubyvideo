    Vienna.rb is back! Are you interested in the Ruby language or Ruby on Rails? Join us. We have great talks, good vibes, and cookies! 🍪

    Talks
    ~~~~~

    🗣️ Grzegorz Jakubiak
    ▶️ Refine Your Monkey Patch
    🗒️ A practical guide to monkey patching without introducing unexpected bugs. Learn techniques to safely extend your code without unwanted side effects, using Ruby’s refinement feature—a tool Matz has labeled a failure. This talk will equip you with best practices for patching responsibly.

    🗣️ Thomas Leitner
    ▶️ 10 Years of HexaPDF
    🗒️ A look at how HexaPDF came to be, from idea to running a business. The journey was (and still is) filled with challenges, happy moments and things one should -in hindsight - definitely not do! 🙂 The talk is light on the technical side of HexaPDF and focuses more on the things I did and learned.

    🗣️ Nicolas Dular
    ▶️ An Epic Migration
    🗒️ Join me on our epic adventure of migrating GitLab epics! In this talk, I'll dive into the challenges of executing zero-downtime migrations at scale, why we opted for bi-directional syncing (and the struggles that came with it), and how we coordinated the project. Come for the tech insights, and stay for the stories of how we tracked down out-of-sync data!

    ⭐ Meister

    Founded in 2006 by Till Vollmer and Michael Hollauf, Meister’s journey from start-up to scale-up has been a story of continual growth. What started with a vision to create a simple visual mind-mapping tool has become not one but two collaborative tools that help teams everywhere focus on the work that matters.

    Thank you to Meister for hosting and providing us with refreshments and snacks! 🙌
