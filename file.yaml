    Breaking up with the bundle by Joel Hawksley

    Over the course of 14 years, the GitHub.com CSS bundle grew to over 40,000 lines of custom CSS. It became almost impossible to refactor. Visual regressions were common. In this talk, we'll share an honest picture of our successes and failures as we've worked to break up with our CSS bundle by moving towards a component-driven UI architecture.

  description: I was fully onboard with React as my front-end Javascript framework
    of choice for years. That all changed when I suddenly had to support a stand-alone
    React app that I had no hand in building. Thankfully Hotwire had just been released,
    and my manager was aware of how painful maintaining this application was going
    to be. So I started the process of migrating the React app into the Rails app,
    using Hotwire as the new front-end framework. How did it go, what lessons were
    learned, and would I do it again?

- title: Caching Without Marshal
  raw_title: RailsConf 2022 - Caching Without Marshal by Chris Salzberg
  description: |-
    Marshal is Ruby's ultimate sharp knife, able to transform any object into a binary blob and back. This makes it a natural match for the diverse needs of a cache.

    But Marshal's magic comes with risks. Code changes can break deploys; user input can trigger an RCE.

    We recently decided these risks were not worth it. Breaking with convention, we migrated the cache on our core monolith to MessagePack, a more compact binary serialization format with stricter typing and less magic.

    In this talk, I'll pry Marshal open to show how it works, how we replaced it, and why you might want to do the same.

    and easy to build with... right up until you want to deploy your app to production.
    At that point, the hand-holding ends. Like the Roadrunner, Rails stops right before
    the cliff and lets you, Wile E. Coyote, sail over the edge. We have active record
    for interacting with databases, active storage for storing files, etc, but where's

    One common recommendation for aspiring software developers is to pursue a degree in Computer Science (CS).

    The open source gem ecosystem is a major strength of Ruby and it’s not uncommon for a production Rails application to depend upon hundreds of gems. But what are the risks of installing a gem and having it in your Gemfile?

    In this talk, we’ll cover what “bad things” can actually happen when you install a gem. We’ll also talk about the ways of preventing these attacks from occurring in your application dependencies (so you can sleep well at night).

    In 2009 _why tweeted: "programming is rather thankless. you see your works become replaced by superior works in a year. unable to run at all in a few more."
    I take this as a call to action to run old code. In this talk we dig, together, through historical Ruby. We will have fun excavating interesting gems from the past.

    Further, I will answer the following questions:

    What code greater than 12 years old still runs in Ruby 3.1?
    What idioms have changed?
    And for the brave: how can you set up an environment to run Ruby 1.8 code from ~2008 on a modern machine?

    But what if you made decisions a different way? What if you had a sophisticated decision-making apparatus to guide you, built precisely to your needs -- an always-available guide?

    You do! It’s called your somatic intelligence. With practice you can learn to tune into it and let your body lead the way to satisfaction and fulfillment -- in every area of your life.

    That strange phenomenon where air molecules bounce against each other in a way that somehow comforts you, makes you cry, or makes you dance all night: music. Since the advent of recorded audio, a musician doesn't even need to be present anymore for this to happen (which makes putting "I will always love you" on repeat a little less awkward).

    Sound engineers have found many ways of making music sound good when played from a record. Some of their methods have become industry staples used on every recording released today.

  raw_title: RailsConf 2022 - Pictures Of You, Pictures Of Me, Crypto Steganography
    by Sean Marcia
  description: I was puzzled when a friend sent me a Buffy the Vampire Slayer picture
    out of the blue but, knowing that friend is an oddball, thought nothing of it.
    Days later, again without warning, a Babylon 5 picture. A few days after that
    a picture from Firefly. Then he repeated the pictures. A cryptic comment led me
    to understand that there was more to them than met the eye. Come learn the history,
    applications, and math behind crypto steganography how unravelling the mystery
    of the pictures culminated in the resolution of a 15 year rivalry when the US
    Olympic men’s curling team won the gold in 2018.

  raw_title: RailsConf 2022 - Come on in! Making yourself at home in a new codebase
    by Mercedes Bernard
  description: "\"Welcome! We're so excited to have you \U0001F917 please excuse the
    mess.\" – if a codebase could talk\n\nWhen we join a new team or start a new project,
    we have to onboard to the codebase. Diving into code that we're unfamiliar with
    can be stressful or make us feel like we don't know what we're doing. And the
    longer the codebase has been around, the more intense those feelings can be. But
    there are steps we can take to understand new code and start contributing quickly.
    In this talk, we'll cover how to build our code comprehension skills and how to
    make our own code welcoming to guests in the future."

  raw_title: RailsConf 2022 - A Rails Developer’s Guide To The Ruby VM by Maple Ong
  description: |-
    What happens under the hood when you run a Ruby script as simple as puts “Hello World!”?

    Time to switch gears from the Rails-level of abstraction to a lower one and dive into some Ruby internals. We’ll be learning about how the Ruby code you write gets compiled and executed, then zoom in to the VM-level – what VMs are and what they do, and how the Ruby VM works. You’ll walk away with a better understanding of how Ruby and Rails works as a whole. No low-level systems knowledge needed!

  description: 'Have you ever wanted to know what a monad is? How about a functor?
    What about algebraic data types and parametric polymorphism? If you''ve been interested
    in these ideas but scared off by the language, you''re not alone: for an approach
    that champions composing simple pieces, functional programming is full of complex
    jargon. In this talk, we''ll cover these topics from a Ruby and Rails perspective,
    composing small ideas in everyday language. Before we''re through, you''ll have
    a rich new set of FP ideas to apply to your projects—and you''ll finally learn
    what a monad is (hint: it''s not a burrito).'

- title: The pitfalls of realtime-ification
  raw_title: RailsConf 2022 - The pitfalls of realtime-ification by Vladimir Dementyev
  description: |-
    Building realtime applications with Rails has become a no-brainer since Action Cable came around. With Hotwire, we don't even need to leave the comfort zone of HTML and controllers to introduce live updates to a Rails app. Realtime-ification in every house!

    Switching to realtime hides many pitfalls you'd better learn beforehand. How to broadcast personalized data? How not to miss updates during connection losses? Who's online? Does it scale?

    Let me dig into these problems and demonstrate how to resolve them for Action Cable and Hotwire.

    later, it was gone. \U0001F62D\n\nThis failed experiment paved the way for a new
    Ruby podcast: Remote Ruby. 170 episodes later, we've learned a lot! We had no
    previous experience podcasting before the first episode. Along the way we've learned
    things like what kind of gear to use, how to perform interviews, and affirmed
    just how lovely the Ruby community is.\n\nIt's your turn! Come to learn from our

  description: 'One definition of the middle: a difficult or unpleasant position.
    Yuck! It certainly can feel that way for mid-level developers. Fortunately, we''ve
    uncovered a model that will help managers create an environment where their devs
    can thrive. Our Learn it Do it Teach it (LDT) model will foster more learning,
    while keeping their hands on the code, and adding in the magic touch, teaching.
    This talk will demonstrate how managers can implement a LDT model into a developer’s
    day to day. Growth plans like this model will allow your team to move from mids
    into seniors both faster and more confidently.'
